### Couchbase Lite Community utility library for macOS and Raspberry Pi OS


### This code is basically "alpha level."  The API will change and some functions are known to be broken.  

### That said, much of the library appears to be working.  This static library is meant to be an abstraction layer over the Couchbase Lite Community libraries that offer an embedded, client-side noSQL document database.  This functionality is perfect for developers looking for a document store that is (potentially) platform-agnostic and usable for non-commercial uses in their applications.  The primary focus will be on macOS first, Raspberry Pi second (not as an afterthought so much as the macOS platform is the critical need at the moment).

## Important
### Couchbase technology and the Couchbase libraries are property of [Couchbase Inc.](https://www.couchbase.com)  This library makes no claims on this technology nor intends to provide support for any issues related to its use (nor address any potential defects in their software).
